## Update the GitHub Secrets environment file

A GitHub secrets environment file simplifies the process of uploading the secrets to one or more GitHub repos.

Use the github.env file you received from the GitHub Metrics solution owner or the one you created in the [Deploy the GitHub Metrics solution](../10-deploy-solution/03-introduction.md) section.

1. Open the **github.env** file in the `deploy` folder of the cloned repo.
1. Update the **REPORTING_PAT** value with the Personal Access Token you copied to the clipboard in the previous step.
1. Update the **REPORTING_GROUP** field. The group secret is used for consolidated reporting. The group name is arbitrary, for example, use your team name or your GitHub name.
1. The **REPORTING_ENDPOINT_URL** and **REPORTING_ENDPOINT_KEY** values are populated by the GitHub Metrics solution owner.
