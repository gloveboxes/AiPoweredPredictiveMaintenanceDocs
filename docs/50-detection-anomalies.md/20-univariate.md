# Univariate anomaly detection

## Update the Notebook environment config file

Using your favorite text editor, open the file `Notebooks/.env` and update the following values using the values from the deployment output that you saved in the previous section.

- storage_connection_string=
- anomaly_detector_key=
- inference_telemetry_endpoint_url=
- inference_telemetry_endpoint_key=

## Start the Jupyter Notebook server

1. Navigate to the `Notebooks` folder.
1. Start the Jupyter Notebook server by running the following command:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

1. A browser window will open and display the Jupyter Notebook dashboard. Click on the `univariate.ipynb` notebook to open it.
1. Run the notebook cells one at a time. The notebook will walk you through the process of loading the data, training the model, and detecting anomalies.

The notebook will show a plot of the predicted anomalies. The plot will show the predicted anomalies as red dots. The plot will also show the actual anomalies as red circles. The red circles are the actual anomalies that were generated by the HVAC simulator app. The red dots are the predicted anomalies generated by the anomaly detection model.
