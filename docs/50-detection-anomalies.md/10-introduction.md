# Introduction

Azure Anomaly Detector is a member of the [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cognitive-services/#overview) family of services. Cognitive Services brings AI within reach of every developer and data scientist. With leading models, a variety of use cases can be unlocked. All it takes is an API call to embed the ability to see, hear, speak, search, understand, and accelerate advanced decision-making into your apps.

Azure Anomaly Detector is a service that detects anomalies automatically in time series data. It supports Univariate and Multivariate anomaly detection. Univariate anomaly detection is used to detect anomalies in a single time series. Multivariate anomaly detection is used to detect anomalies in multiple time series.

This lab will walk you through the steps to use Azure Anomaly Detector to detect anomalies in IoT telemetry data. The lab will use the HVAC simulator app or the Azure Sphere HVAC app that you deployed in the previous section. The lab will use the Azure Anomaly Detector REST API to detect anomalies in the telemetry data.

<!-- Azure Cognitive Services are a collection of intelligent APIs that you can use to add cognitive features to your applications without having to build the models yourself. -->
